I am a Science officer at Open Science Tools and postdoctoral researcher at Trinity College Dublin. I have a passion for helping scientists make behavioural experiments and helping others gain confidence with coding. In my role at Open Science Tools, I support scientists through consultancy, workshops and generating free online learning materials. 

My own research focuses on multisenory perception and attention across the lifespan using a combination of psychophysics and EEG. Currently I works with the Multisensory Cognition Lab in Dublin and The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) investigating multisensory perception in a large sample of adults aged over 50 years.
