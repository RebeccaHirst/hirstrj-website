abstract: The ability to inhibit ongoing responses that suddenly become inappropriate
  is essential for safe and effective interaction with an ever-changing and unpredictable
  world. Response inhibition is quantified by the unobservablestop-signal reaction
  time (SSRT), the completion time of an inhibitory process triggered by a signal
  to stop responding. SSRTs can be inferred based on a model in which inhibitory and
  response processes race with each other to control behavior. Inhibition is usually
  studied in the context of choice responses, but there has been increasing interest
  in what is often a key component of skilled behavior, stopping a response that is
  timed to coincide with an anticipated event. We show that SSRT measurement via the
  standard race model fails for anticipated responses because the stop signal changes
  the perception of the passage of time, due to the long-known “filled-interval illusion”.
  We propose a computational model of anticipated response inhibitionthat takes account
  of this distortion of time perception and show that this model produces valid estimates
  of not only SSRT, but also another key process that determines inhibitory ability,
  lapses in attention. Our new modeland accompanying Bayesian estimation procedures
  provide a solid basis for the burgeoning study of timed-action control.
