abstract: The thalamus is a central hub of the autonomic network and thalamic volume
  has been associated with high-risk phenotypes for sudden cardiac death. Heart rate
  response to physiological stressors (e.g., standing) and the associated recovery
  patterns provide reliable indicators of both autonomic function and cardiovascular
  risk. Here we examine if thalamic volume may be a risk marker for impaired heart
  rate recovery in response to orthostatic challenge. The Irish Longitudinal Study
  on Aging involves a nationally representative sample of older individuals aged ≥50
  years. Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging and orthostatic heart rate recovery
  were available for a cross-sectional sample of 430 participants. Multivariable regression
  and linear mixed-effects models were adjusted for head size, age, sex, education,
  body mass index, blood pressure, history of cardiovascular diseases and events,
  cardiovascular medication, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol intake, timed up-and-go
  (a measure of physical frailty), physical exercise and depression. Smaller thalamic
  volume was associated with slower heart rate recovery (−1.4 bpm per 1 cm3 thalamic
  volume, 95% CI −2.01 to −0.82; p textless .001). In multivariable analysis, participants
  with smaller thalamic volumes had a mean heart rate recovery −2.7 bpm slower than
  participants with larger thalamic volumes (95% CI −3.89 to −1.61; p textless .001).
  Covariates associated with smaller thalamic volume included age, history of diabetes,
  and heavy alcohol consumption. Thalamic volume may be an indicator of the structural
  integrity of the central autonomic network. It may be a clinical biomarker for stratification
  of individuals at risk of autonomic dysfunction, cardiovascular events, and sudden
  cardiac death.
