abstract: In the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI) sound dramatically alters visual
  perception, as presenting a single flash with two beeps results in the perception
  of two flashes. In this comprehensive review, we synthesise 20 years of research
  using the SIFI, from over 100 studies. We discuss the neural and computational principles
  governing this illusion and examine the influence of perceptual experience, development,
  ageing and clinical conditions. Convergent findings show that the SIFI results from
  optimal integration and probabilistic inference and directly reflects crossmodal
  interactions in the temporal domain. Its neural basis lies in early modulation of
  visual cortex by auditory and multisensory regions. The SIFI shows increasingly
  strong potential as an efficient tool for measuring multisensory processing. Greater
  harmonisation across studies is now required to maximise this poÂ­ tential. We therefore
  propose considerations for researchers relating to choice of stimulus parameters
  and signpost directions for future research.
