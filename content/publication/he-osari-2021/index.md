abstract: The stop-signal paradigm has become ubiquitous in investigations of inhibitory
  control. Tasks inspired by the paradigm, referred to as stop-signal tasks, require
  participants to make responses on go trials and to inhibit those responses when
  presented with a stop-signal on stop trials. Currently, the most popular version
  of the stop-signal task is the ‘choice-reaction’ variant, where participants make
  choice responses, but must inhibit those responses when presented with a stop-signal.
  An alternative to the choice-reaction variant of the stop-signal task is the ‘anticipated
  response inhibition’ task. In anticipated response inhibition tasks, participants
  are required to make a planned response that coincides with a predictably timed
  event (such as lifting a finger from a computer key to stop a filling bar at a predefined
  target). Anticipated response inhibition tasks have some advantages over the more
  traditional choice-reaction stop-signal tasks and are becoming increasingly popular.
  However, currently, there are no openly available versions of the anticipated response
  inhibition task, limiting potential uptake. Here, we present an open-source, free,
  and ready-to-use version of the anticipated response inhibition task, which we refer
  to as the OSARI (the Open-Source Anticipated Response Inhibition) task.
