 abstract = {Across development, vision increasingly influences audiovisual perception. This is evidenced in illusions such as the McGurk effect, in which a seen mouth movement changes the perceived sound. The current paper assessed the effects of manipulating the clarity of the heard and seen signal upon the McGurk effect in children aged 3-6 (n = 29), 7-9 (n = 32) and 10-12 (n = 29) years, and adults aged 20-35 years (n = 32). Auditory noise increased, and visual blur decreased, the likelihood of vision changing auditory perception. Based upon a proposed developmental shift from auditory to visual dominance we predicted that younger children would be less susceptible to McGurk responses, and that adults would continue to be influenced by vision in higher levels of visual noise and with less auditory noise. Susceptibility to the McGurk effect was higher in adults compared with 3-6-year-olds and 7-9-year-olds but not 10-12-year-olds. Younger children required more auditory noise, and less visual noise, than adults to induce McGurk responses (i.e. adults and older children were more easily influenced by vision). Reduced susceptibility in childhood supports the theory that sensory dominance shifts across development and reaches adult-like levels by 10 years of age. The ability to combine auditory and visual information (audio-visual integration) in noisy environments is essential in every day life, such as when holding a conversation. Individuals may differ in the extent to which one sense (or modality) alters or is dominant over another. The McGurk effect exemplifies this, as hearing a voice say "Ba" and seeing a face say "Ga" often results in perception of an alternative syllable such as "Da" or "Tha" 1. Sensory dominance, or different weighting between sensory modalities results in different perceptual effects. Visual dominance results in a response to the seen mouth movement, auditory dominance a response to the sound and equal weighting results in a fusion of the two. Alternatively, fusion responses have also been interpreted as visual dominance 2 , where the seen mouth movement alters the sound reported by participants. Modality dominance might be flexible depending on context 3,4 and age 5-7. In some audiovisual paradigms, visual influence appears stronger in adults compared with children 5,8,9. Children also manifest a preference for auditory information when processing multisensory events 5,10-13. Sloutsky & Napolitano (2003) found that following adaptation to an audiovisual stimulus, adults were more likely to identify a second stimulus as novel if the visual dimension was altered. Conversely, 4-year-olds identified a stimulus as novel if the auditory dimension changed. Furthermore, studies exploring cross-modal interference effects have reported that 4-5-year-olds struggle to inhibit auditory input 14. Therefore, perception in young childhood appears to be driven by audition. The perceptual consequences of auditory dominance in childhood are evident in multisensory illusions. Children are more susceptible to illusions in which auditory information modulates vision. In the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion, participants perceive a single flash as two flashes when presented with two concurrent beeps 15. Innes-Brown et al. (2011) found 8-17-year-olds were more susceptible to the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion compared with adults 16 (however see 17). Conversely, children appear less susceptible to the McGurk effect, maintaining veridical perception of sound despite incongruent visual information 18,19. Tremblay et al. (2007) found that 5-9-year-olds made correct auditory "Ba" responses on ̃60% of incongruent McGurk trials. This dropped to \̃20-30% in 10-19-year-olds, suggesting older children are more susceptible to the McGurk effect. One explanation of developmental differences is that children manifest delayed development of multisensory integration processes 20 and thus are less susceptible to multisensory illusions. Nevertheless, children experience other multisensory illusions, such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion 16 , and susceptibility to the McGurk effect is modulated by sensory weighting in childhood.
