abstract: Multisensory perception might provide an important marker of brain function
  in aging. However, the cortical structures supporting multisensory perception in
  aging are poorly understood. In this study, we compared regional gray matter volume
  in a group of middle-aged (n ¼ 101; 49e64 years) and older (n ¼ 116; 71e87 years)
  adults from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging using voxel-based morphometry.
  Participants completed a measure of multisensory integration, the sound-induced
  ﬂash illusion, and were grouped as per their illusion susceptibility. A signiﬁcant
  interaction was observed in the right angular gyrus; in the middle-aged group, larger
  gray matter volume corresponded to stronger illusion perception while in older adults
  larger gray matter corresponded to less illusion susceptibility. This interaction
  remained signiﬁcant even when controlling for a range of demographic, sensory, cognitive,
  and health variables. These ﬁndings show that multisensory integration is associated
  with speciﬁc structural differences in the aging brain and highlight the angular
  gyrus as a possible “cross-modal hub” associated with age-related change in multisensory
  perception.
