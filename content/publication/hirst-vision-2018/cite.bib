 abstract = {The Colavita eﬀect occurs when participants respond only to the visual element of an audio-visual stimulus. This visual dominance eﬀect is proposed to arise from asymmetric facilitation and inhibition between modalities. It has also been proposed that, unlike adults, children appear predisposed to auditory information. We provide the ﬁrst quantitative synthesis of studies exploring the Colavita eﬀect, combining data from 70 experiments across 14 studies. A mixed-meta-regression model was applied to assess whether the Colavita eﬀect is inﬂuenced by methodological factors and age group tested. Studies reporting response time data were used to test for the presence of asymmetrical facilitation between modalities. Studies with adult participants yielded a medium, approaching large, eﬀect size. Studies exploring the Colavita eﬀect in children yielded no Colavita eﬀect. Across adult and child studies, no methodological factors inﬂuenced the eﬀect. Contrary to asymmetrical facilitation, response time data suggested a general slowing under bimodal conditions. These ﬁndings suggest that whilst vision dominates in adults, this eﬀect is absent in childhood.},
