abstract: The Colavita eﬀect occurs when participants respond only to the visual element
  of an audio-visual stimulus. This visual dominance eﬀect is proposed to arise from
  asymmetric facilitation and inhibition between modalities. It has also been proposed
  that, unlike adults, children appear predisposed to auditory information. We provide
  the ﬁrst quantitative synthesis of studies exploring the Colavita eﬀect, combining
  data from 70 experiments across 14 studies. A mixed-meta-regression model was applied
  to assess whether the Colavita eﬀect is inﬂuenced by methodological factors and
  age group tested. Studies reporting response time data were used to test for the
  presence of asymmetrical facilitation between modalities. Studies with adult participants
  yielded a medium, approaching large, eﬀect size. Studies exploring the Colavita
  eﬀect in children yielded no Colavita eﬀect. Across adult and child studies, no
  methodological factors inﬂuenced the eﬀect. Contrary to asymmetrical facilitation,
  response time data suggested a general slowing under bimodal conditions. These ﬁndings
  suggest that whilst vision dominates in adults, this eﬀect is absent in childhood.
