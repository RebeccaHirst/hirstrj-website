abstract: Sensory impairment is common in ageing, as are approaches to treat it. However,
  the impact of age-related sensory impairment upon multisensory perception remains
  unexplored, despite the multisensory nature of our environment. Here, we used data
  from The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA) to investigate whether common,
  age-related eye diseases (cataracts, glaucoma and Age-Related Macular Degeneration,
  ARMD) and clinical intervention to improve sensory function (cataract removal and
  hearing aids) inﬂuence multisensory integration in older adults. Integration was
  measured using the SoundInduced Flash Illusion (SIFI), and the extent to which identifying
  two ﬂashes was improved by accompanying auditory information (“visual gain”). Visual
  gain was not inﬂuenced by eye disease or treatment. For the SIFI, participants self-reporting
  cataracts, ARMD or glaucoma were as susceptible as healthy controls, even when controlling
  for age, sex, cognition, self-reported vision/hearing and visual acuity. In a second
  analysis using retinal photographs, glaucoma and ARMD (hard drusen) did not inﬂuence
  susceptibility relative to controls. However, participants with soft drusen ARMD
  were more susceptible to the illusion at long Stimulus-Onset Asynchronies (SOAs)
  compared with controls. Following this, we identiﬁed groups reporting bilateral
  cataract removal or hearing aid acquisition textgreater4 years and textless2 years
  prior to assessment, enabling comparison of longer- and shorter-term effects of
  interventions. Cataract removal groups did not differ from controls. Longer-term
  hearing aid users were less susceptible to the SIFI at short SOAs compared with
  controls. Our ﬁndings suggest that multisensory integration in ageing might be speciﬁcally
  inﬂuenced by ARMD (soft drusen) and hearing aid use.
