abstract: 'Research deployed via the internet and administered via smartphones could
  have access to more diverse samples than lab-based research. Diverse samples could
  have relatively high variation in their traits and so yield relatively reliable
  measurements of individual differences in these traits. Cognitive tasks have been
  reported to yield relatively low reliabilities (Hedge et al., 2018), which could
  potentially be addressed by smartphonemediated administration in diverse samples.
  We formulate several criteria to determine whether a cognitive task is suitable
  for individual differences research on commodity smartphones: no very brief or precise
  stimulus timing, relative response times (RTs), a maximum of two response options,
  and a small number of graphical stimuli. The Flanker Task meets these criteria.
  We compared the reliability of individual differences in the Flanker Effect across
  samples and devices in a pre-registered study. We found no evidence that a more
  diverse sample yields higher reliabilities. We also found no evidence that commodity
  smartphones yield lower reliabilities than commodity laptops. Hence, diverse samples
  might not improve reliability above student samples, but smartphones may well measure
  individual differences with cognitive tasks reliably. Exploratively, we examined
  different reliability coefficients, split-half reliabilities, and the development
  of reliability estimates as a function of task length.'
