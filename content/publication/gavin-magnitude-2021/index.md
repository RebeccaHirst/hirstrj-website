abstract: The sound-induced flash illusion occurs when a rapidly presented visual
  stimulus is accompanied by two auditory stimuli, creating the illusory percept of
  two visual stimuli. While much research has focused on how the temporal proximity
  of the audiovisual stimuli impacts susceptibility to the illusion, comparatively
  less research has been dedicated to investigating the impact of spatial manipulations.
  Here, we aimed to assess whether manipulating the eccentricity of visual flash stimuli
  altered the properties of the temporal binding window associated with the SIFI.
  Twenty participants were required to report whether they perceived one or two flashes
  that were concurrently presented with one or two beeps. Visual stimuli were presented
  at one of four different retinal eccentricities (2.5, 5, 7.5 or 10 degrees below
  fixation) and audiovisual stimuli were separated by one of eight stimulus-onset
  asynchronies. In keeping with previous findings, increasing stimulus-onset asynchrony
  between the auditory and visual stimuli led to a marked decrease in susceptibility
  to the illusion allowing us to estimate the width and amplitude of the temporal
  binding window. However, varying the eccentricity of the visual stimulus had no
  effect on either the width or the peak amplitude of the temporal binding window,
  with a similar pattern of results observed for both the “fission” and “fusion” variants
  of the illusion. Thus, spatial manipulations of the audiovisual stimuli used to
  elicit the SIFI appear to have a weaker effect on the integration of sensory signals
  than temporal manipulations, a finding which has implications for neuroanatomical
  models of multisensory integration.
