abstract: Recent studies suggest that the lived environment can affect cogni­ tion
  across the lifespan. We examined, in a large cohort of older adults (n = 3447),
  whether susceptibility to a multisensory illusion, the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion
  (SIFI), was influenced by the reported urbanity of current and childhood (at age
  14 years) resi­ dence. If urban environments help to shape healthy perceptual function,
  we predicted reduced SIFI susceptibility in urban dwellers. Participants reporting
  urban, compared with rural, childhood resi­ dence were less susceptible to SIFI
  at longer Stimulus-Onset Asynchronies (SOAs). Those currently residing in urban
  environments were more susceptible to SIFI at longer SOAs, particularly if they
  scored low on general cognitive function. These findings held even when controlling
  for a several covariates, such as age, sex, education, social participation and
  cognitive ability. Exposure to urban environ­ ments in childhood may influence individual
  differences in percep­ tion and offer a multisensory perceptual benefit in older
  age.
