abstract = {The thalamus is a central hub of the autonomic network and thalamic volume has been associated with high-risk phenotypes for sudden cardiac death. Heart rate response to physiological stressors (e.g., standing) and the associated recovery patterns provide reliable indicators of both autonomic function and cardiovascular risk. Here we examine if thalamic volume may be a risk marker for impaired heart rate recovery in response to orthostatic challenge. The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging involves a nationally representative sample of older individuals aged ≥50 years. Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging and orthostatic heart rate recovery were available for a cross-sectional sample of 430 participants. Multivariable regression and linear mixed-effects models were adjusted for head size, age, sex, education, body mass index, blood pressure, history of cardiovascular diseases and events, cardiovascular medication, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol intake, timed up-and-go (a measure of physical frailty), physical exercise and depression. Smaller thalamic volume was associated with slower heart rate recovery (−1.4 bpm per 1 cm3 thalamic volume, 95{\%} CI −2.01 to −0.82; p {\textless}.001). In multivariable analysis, participants with smaller thalamic volumes had a mean heart rate recovery −2.7 bpm slower than participants with larger thalamic volumes (95{\%} CI −3.89 to −1.61; p {\textless}.001). Covariates associated with smaller thalamic volume included age, history of diabetes, and heavy alcohol consumption. Thalamic volume may be an indicator of the structural integrity of the central autonomic network. It may be a clinical biomarker for stratification of individuals at risk of autonomic dysfunction, cardiovascular events, and sudden cardiac death.},

abstract = {Commonly displayed functional asymmetries such as hand dominance and hemispheric speech lateralisation are well researched in adults. However there is debate about when such functions become lateralised in the typically developing brain. This study examined whether patterns of speech laterality and hand dominance were related and whether they varied with age in typically developing children. 148 children aged 3–10 years performed an electronic pegboard task to determine hand dominance; a subset of 38 of these children also underwent functional Transcranial Doppler (fTCD) imaging to derive a lateralisation index (LI) for hemispheric activation during speech production using an animation description paradigm. There was no main effect of age in the speech laterality scores, however, younger children showed a greater difference in performance between their hands on the motor task. Furthermore, this between-hand performance difference significantly interacted with direction of speech laterality, with a smaller between-hand difference relating to increased left hemisphere activation. This data shows that both handedness and speech lateralisation appear relatively determined by age 3, but that atypical cerebral lateralisation is linked to greater performance differences in hand skill, irrespective of age. Results are discussed in terms of the common neural systems underpinning handedness and speech lateralisation.},

abstract = {Sensory impairment is common in ageing, as are approaches to treat it. However, the impact of age-related sensory impairment upon multisensory perception remains unexplored, despite the multisensory nature of our environment. Here, we used data from The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA) to investigate whether common, age-related eye diseases (cataracts, glaucoma and Age-Related Macular Degeneration, ARMD) and clinical intervention to improve sensory function (cataract removal and hearing aids) influence multisensory integration in older adults. Integration was measured using the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI), and the extent to which identifying two flashes was improved by accompanying auditory information (“visual gain”). Visual gain was not influenced by eye disease or treatment. For the SIFI, participants self-reporting cataracts, ARMD or glaucoma were as susceptible as healthy controls, even when controlling for age, sex, cognition, self-reported vision/hearing and visual acuity. In a second analysis using retinal photographs, glaucoma and ARMD (hard drusen) did not influence susceptibility relative to controls. However, participants with soft drusen ARMD were more susceptible to the illusion at long Stimulus-Onset Asynchronies (SOAs) compared with controls. Following this, we identified groups reporting bilateral cataract removal or hearing aid acquisition {\textgreater}4 years and {\textless}2 years prior to assessment, enabling comparison of longer- and shorter-term effects of interventions. Cataract removal groups did not differ from controls. Longer-term hearing aid users were less susceptible to the SIFI at short SOAs compared with controls. Our findings suggest that multisensory integration in ageing might be specifically influenced by ARMD (soft drusen) and hearing aid use.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Across development, vision increasingly influences audiovisual perception. This is evidenced in illusions such as the McGurk effect, in which a seen mouth movement changes the perceived sound. The current paper assessed the effects of manipulating the clarity of the heard and seen signal upon the McGurk effect in children aged 3-6 (n = 29), 7-9 (n = 32) and 10-12 (n = 29) years, and adults aged 20-35 years (n = 32). Auditory noise increased, and visual blur decreased, the likelihood of vision changing auditory perception. Based upon a proposed developmental shift from auditory to visual dominance we predicted that younger children would be less susceptible to McGurk responses, and that adults would continue to be influenced by vision in higher levels of visual noise and with less auditory noise. Susceptibility to the McGurk effect was higher in adults compared with 3-6-year-olds and 7-9-year-olds but not 10-12-year-olds. Younger children required more auditory noise, and less visual noise, than adults to induce McGurk responses (i.e. adults and older children were more easily influenced by vision). Reduced susceptibility in childhood supports the theory that sensory dominance shifts across development and reaches adult-like levels by 10 years of age. The ability to combine auditory and visual information (audio-visual integration) in noisy environments is essential in every day life, such as when holding a conversation. Individuals may differ in the extent to which one sense (or modality) alters or is dominant over another. The McGurk effect exemplifies this, as hearing a voice say "Ba" and seeing a face say "Ga" often results in perception of an alternative syllable such as "Da" or "Tha" 1. Sensory dominance, or different weighting between sensory modalities results in different perceptual effects. Visual dominance results in a response to the seen mouth movement, auditory dominance a response to the sound and equal weighting results in a fusion of the two. Alternatively, fusion responses have also been interpreted as visual dominance 2 , where the seen mouth movement alters the sound reported by participants. Modality dominance might be flexible depending on context 3,4 and age 5-7. In some audiovisual paradigms, visual influence appears stronger in adults compared with children 5,8,9. Children also manifest a preference for auditory information when processing multisensory events 5,10-13. Sloutsky {\&} Napolitano (2003) found that following adaptation to an audiovisual stimulus, adults were more likely to identify a second stimulus as novel if the visual dimension was altered. Conversely, 4-year-olds identified a stimulus as novel if the auditory dimension changed. Furthermore, studies exploring cross-modal interference effects have reported that 4-5-year-olds struggle to inhibit auditory input 14. Therefore, perception in young childhood appears to be driven by audition. The perceptual consequences of auditory dominance in childhood are evident in multisensory illusions. Children are more susceptible to illusions in which auditory information modulates vision. In the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion, participants perceive a single flash as two flashes when presented with two concurrent beeps 15. Innes-Brown et al. (2011) found 8-17-year-olds were more susceptible to the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion compared with adults 16 (however see 17). Conversely, children appear less susceptible to the McGurk effect, maintaining veridical perception of sound despite incongruent visual information 18,19. Tremblay et al. (2007) found that 5-9-year-olds made correct auditory "Ba" responses on {\~{}}60{\%} of incongruent McGurk trials. This dropped to {\~{}}20-30{\%} in 10-19-year-olds, suggesting older children are more susceptible to the McGurk effect. One explanation of developmental differences is that children manifest delayed development of multisensory integration processes 20 and thus are less susceptible to multisensory illusions. Nevertheless, children experience other multisensory illusions, such as the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion 16 , and susceptibility to the McGurk effect is modulated by sensory weighting in childhood.
