	abstract = {The Colavita eﬀect occurs when participants respond only to the visual element of an audio-visual stimulus. This visual dominance eﬀect is proposed to arise from asymmetric facilitation and inhibition between modalities. It has also been proposed that, unlike adults, children appear predisposed to auditory information. We provide the ﬁrst quantitative synthesis of studies exploring the Colavita eﬀect, combining data from 70 experiments across 14 studies. A mixed-meta-regression model was applied to assess whether the Colavita eﬀect is inﬂuenced by methodological factors and age group tested. Studies reporting response time data were used to test for the presence of asymmetrical facilitation between modalities. Studies with adult participants yielded a medium, approaching large, eﬀect size. Studies exploring the Colavita eﬀect in children yielded no Colavita eﬀect. Across adult and child studies, no methodological factors inﬂuenced the eﬀect. Contrary to asymmetrical facilitation, response time data suggested a general slowing under bimodal conditions. These ﬁndings suggest that whilst vision dominates in adults, this eﬀect is absent in childhood.},

In this comprehensive review, we synthesise 20 years of research using the SIFI, from over 100 studies. We discuss the neural and computational principles governing this illusion and examine the influence of perceptual experience, development, ageing and clinical conditions. Convergent findings show that the SIFI results from optimal integration and probabilistic inference and directly reflects crossmodal interactions in the temporal domain. Its neural basis lies in early modulation of visual cortex by auditory and multisensory regions. The SIFI shows increasingly strong potential as an efficient tool for measuring multisensory processing. Greater harmonisation across studies is now required to maximise this po­ tential. We therefore propose considerations for researchers relating to choice of stimulus parameters and signpost directions for future research.},

            Perception of our world is proposed to arise from combining multiple sensory inputs according to their relative reliability. We tested multisensory processes in a large sample of 2920 older adults to assess whether sensory ability mediates age-related changes in perception. Participants completed a test of audio-visual integration, the Sound Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI), alongside measures of visual (acuity, contrast sensitivity, self-reported vision and visual temporal discrimination (VTD)) and auditory (self-reported hearing and auditory temporal discrimination (ATD)) function. Structural equation modelling showed that SIFI susceptibility increased with age. This was mediated by visual acuity and self-reported hearing: better scores on these measures predicted reduced and stronger SIFI susceptibility, respectively. Unexpectedly, VTD improved with age and predicted increased SIFI susceptibility. Importantly, the relationship between age and SIFI susceptibility remained significant, even when considering mediators. A second model showed that, with age, visual ‘gain’ (the benefit of congruent auditory information on visual judgements) was predicted by ATD: better ATD predicted stronger visual gain. However, neither age nor SIFI susceptibility were directly associated with visual gain. Our findings illustrate, in the largest sample of older adults to date, how multisensory perception is influenced, but not fully accounted for, by age-related changes in unisensory abilities.},

	abstract = {Sensory impairment is common in ageing, as are approaches to treat it. However, the impact of age-related sensory impairment upon multisensory perception remains unexplored, despite the multisensory nature of our environment. Here, we used data from The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA) to investigate whether common, age-related eye diseases (cataracts, glaucoma and Age-Related Macular Degeneration, ARMD) and clinical intervention to improve sensory function (cataract removal and hearing aids) inﬂuence multisensory integration in older adults. Integration was measured using the SoundInduced Flash Illusion (SIFI), and the extent to which identifying two ﬂashes was improved by accompanying auditory information (“visual gain”). Visual gain was not inﬂuenced by eye disease or treatment. For the SIFI, participants self-reporting cataracts, ARMD or glaucoma were as susceptible as healthy controls, even when controlling for age, sex, cognition, self-reported vision/hearing and visual acuity. In a second analysis using retinal photographs, glaucoma and ARMD (hard drusen) did not inﬂuence susceptibility relative to controls. However, participants with soft drusen ARMD were more susceptible to the illusion at long Stimulus-Onset Asynchronies (SOAs) compared with controls. Following this, we identiﬁed groups reporting bilateral cataract removal or hearing aid acquisition {\textgreater}4 years and {\textless}2 years prior to assessment, enabling comparison of longer- and shorter-term effects of interventions. Cataract removal groups did not differ from controls. Longer-term hearing aid users were less susceptible to the SIFI at short SOAs compared with controls. Our ﬁndings suggest that multisensory integration in ageing might be speciﬁcally inﬂuenced by ARMD (soft drusen) and hearing aid use.},

Heart rate response to physiological stressors (e.g., standing) and the associated recovery patterns provide reliable indicators of both autonomic function and cardiovascular risk. Here we examine if thalamic volume may be a risk marker for impaired heart rate recovery in response to orthostatic challenge. The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging involves a nationally representative sample of older individuals aged ≥50 years. Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging and orthostatic heart rate recovery were available for a cross-sectional sample of 430 participants. Multivariable regression and linear mixed-effects models were adjusted for head size, age, sex, education, body mass index, blood pressure, history of cardiovascular diseases and events, cardiovascular medication, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol intake, timed up-and-go (a measure of physical frailty), physical exercise and depression. Smaller thalamic volume was associated with slower heart rate recovery (−1.4 bpm per 1 cm3 thalamic volume, 95\% CI −2.01 to −0.82; p {\textless} .001). In multivariable analysis, participants with smaller thalamic volumes had a mean heart rate recovery −2.7 bpm slower than participants with larger thalamic volumes (95\% CI −3.89 to −1.61; p {\textless} .001). Covariates associated with smaller thalamic volume included age, history of diabetes, and heavy alcohol consumption. Thalamic volume may be an indicator of the structural integrity of the central autonomic network. It may be a clinical biomarker for stratification of individuals at risk of autonomic dysfunction, cardiovascular events, and sudden cardiac death.},

	abstract = {Research deployed via the internet and administered via smartphones could have access to more diverse samples than lab-based research. Diverse samples could have relatively high variation in their traits and so yield relatively reliable measurements of individual differences in these traits. Cognitive tasks have been reported to yield relatively low reliabilities (Hedge et al., 2018), which could potentially be addressed by smartphonemediated administration in diverse samples. We formulate several criteria to determine whether a cognitive task is suitable for individual differences research on commodity smartphones: no very brief or precise stimulus timing, relative response times (RTs), a maximum of two response options, and a small number of graphical stimuli. The Flanker Task meets these criteria. We compared the reliability of individual differences in the Flanker Effect across samples and devices in a pre-registered study. We found no evidence that a more diverse sample yields higher reliabilities. We also found no evidence that commodity smartphones yield lower reliabilities than commodity laptops. Hence, diverse samples might not improve reliability above student samples, but smartphones may well measure individual differences with cognitive tasks reliably. Exploratively, we examined different reliability coefficients, split-half reliabilities, and the development of reliability estimates as a function of task length.},

	abstract = {The ability to inhibit ongoing responses that suddenly become inappropriate is essential for safe and effective interaction with an ever-changing and unpredictable world. Response inhibition is quantified by the unobservablestop-signal reaction time (SSRT), the completion time of an inhibitory process triggered by a signal to stop responding. SSRTs can be inferred based on a model in which inhibitory and response processes race with each other to control behavior. Inhibition is usually studied in the context of choice responses, but there has been increasing interest in what is often a key component of skilled behavior, stopping a response that is timed to coincide with an anticipated event. We show that SSRT measurement via the standard race model fails for anticipated responses because the stop signal changes the perception of the passage of time, due to the long-known “filled-interval illusion”. We propose a computational model of anticipated response inhibitionthat takes account of this distortion of time perception and show that this model produces valid estimates of not only SSRT, but also another key process that determines inhibitory ability, lapses in attention. Our new modeland accompanying Bayesian estimation procedures provide a solid basis for the burgeoning study of timed-action control.},

	abstract = {The sound-induced flash illusion occurs when a rapidly presented visual stimulus is accompanied by two auditory stimuli, creating the illusory percept of two visual stimuli. While much research has focused on how the temporal proximity of the audiovisual stimuli impacts susceptibility to the illusion, comparatively less research has been dedicated to investigating the impact of spatial manipulations. Here, we aimed to assess whether manipulating the eccentricity of visual flash stimuli altered the properties of the temporal binding window associated with the SIFI. Twenty participants were required to report whether they perceived one or two flashes that were concurrently presented with one or two beeps. Visual stimuli were presented at one of four different retinal eccentricities (2.5, 5, 7.5 or 10 degrees below fixation) and audiovisual stimuli were separated by one of eight stimulus-onset asynchronies. In keeping with previous findings, increasing stimulus-onset asynchrony between the auditory and visual stimuli led to a marked decrease in susceptibility to the illusion allowing us to estimate the width and amplitude of the temporal binding window. However, varying the eccentricity of the visual stimulus had no effect on either the width or the peak amplitude of the temporal binding window, with a similar pattern of results observed for both the “fission” and “fusion” variants of the illusion. Thus, spatial manipulations of the audiovisual stimuli used to elicit the SIFI appear to have a weaker effect on the integration of sensory signals than temporal manipulations, a finding which has implications for neuroanatomical models of multisensory integration.},

Tasks inspired by the paradigm, referred to as stop-signal tasks, require participants to make responses on go trials and to inhibit those responses when presented with a stop-signal on stop trials.

An alternative to the choice-reaction variant of the stop-signal task is the ‘anticipated response inhibition’ task. In anticipated response inhibition tasks, participants are required to make a planned response that coincides with a predictably timed event (such as lifting a finger from a computer key to stop a filling bar at a predefined target). Anticipated response inhibition tasks have some advantages over the more traditional choice-reaction stop-signal tasks and are becoming increasingly popular. However, currently, there are no openly available versions of the anticipated response inhibition task, limiting potential uptake. Here, we present an open-source, free, and ready-to-use version of the anticipated response inhibition task, which we refer to as the OSARI (the Open-Source Anticipated Response Inhibition) task.},
